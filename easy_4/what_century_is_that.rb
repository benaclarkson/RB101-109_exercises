# Write a method that takes a year as input and returns the century. The return
# value should be a string that begins with the century number, and ends with st,
# nd, rd, or th as appropriate for that number.

# input: year
# output: the century as a string
# rules:
#   - centuries begin with years that end in 01
#   - each century needs to end with the proper st, nd, rd, or th
