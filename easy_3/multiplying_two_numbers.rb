# Create a method that takes two arguments, multiplies them together, and returns
# the result.

# P
# input: 2 arguments
# output: the product of those arguments multiplied together
# questions:
#   - Is data validation required?
#   - Will the method only receive positive integers?
#   - Should I make the method loop until positive integers are given?

# E
# multiply(5, 3) == 15

# D
#

# A
# Create a method that takes two arguments
# Multiply those arguments together and return the result

def multiply(num1, num2)
  num1 * num2
end
